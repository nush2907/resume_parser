Overview
My model is designed to help you find hackathons that are a good fit for someone based on their skills, interests, or experiences. It does this by analyzing text (like a resume or a description of someone's skills) and identifying keywords that match the skills or interests of hackathons.

#How It Works
Text Analysis: The model starts by reading a piece of text. This could be a resume, a list of skills, or any other text that describes someone's skills or interests.
Keyword Extraction: It then looks for specific words or phrases in the text that are related to skills or interests. These could be things like "Python programming", "machine learning", or "startup experience".
Matching Hackathons: With these keywords, the model searches through a list of hackathons. Each hackathon has its own set of keywords that describe what skills or interests they are looking for.
Filtering: The model compares the keywords from the text with the keywords from each hackathon. If there are matches, it means the hackathon might be a good fit for the person described in the text.
Results: Finally, the model provides a list of hackathons that are a good match. This list is based on how well the keywords from the text match the keywords from the hackathons.

#Example
Imagine you have a resume that says you're good at Python programming and have experience with machine learning. Your model would look for hackathons that are looking for participants with these skills. It would then give you a list of hackathons that are interested in people with your skills, making it easier for you to find hackathons that are a good fit for you.
